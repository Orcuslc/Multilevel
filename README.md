- [Reified Bayesian modelling and inference for physical systems](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378375808003303), Goldstein and Rougier, 2009.
We describe an approach, termed reified analysis, for linking the behaviour of mathematical models with inferences about the physical systems which the models represent. We describe the logical basis for the approach, based on coherent assessment of the
